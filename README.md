# Patient Review
# Patient review program with a clean and simple GUI that will have notes for the user on the steps needed to add a Doctor or Nurse into the program and database. The program will have the ability to edit a Doctor or Nurse that is in the database to include moving from one department or clinic to another, if they have additional education later the program will allow for changing the type of Doctor or Nurse. The program will need to validate all the fields that have had information filled into them and loop if an error shows up so that the user can make corrections to any fields that have errors.
# Once people are added to the program they will be saved to the Database. The program will take the list of Doctors or Nurses and randomly sort the list to pick a Doctor to review another Doctor, and Nurses to review other nurses, this will be done by department. The list will be saved and will be compared to the last sorted list in the Database to confirm that the same people don’t review the same people, the program will also make sure a Doctor or Nurse doesn’t review themselves. The sorting will go until all Doctors and Nurses have been reveiwed by another Doctor or Nurse.

# I will be using Visual studios as the tool to create this program. C# will be the language I will be using and SQLite as the database.
